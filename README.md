# Starting up with Arduino

## About Arduino
Arduino is an opensource microcontroller with a massive community around it. This will be my presonal space to experiment new concepts and theories.

## Lessons so far...
1. LED lights - the hello world of Arduino. Entails digital inputs and basic c and cpp syntax. 
2. Servo motors - learned about analog inputs.
3. Stepper motors - learned about analog outputs and introduces integrated circuits.
